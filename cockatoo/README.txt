Cockatoo is a python programming for linux that listens for file changes in the directory it is in. 

Just run python3 cockatoo.py to run and itll run forever in the background. Use <ctrl C> to exit

Why did i name this cockatoo? Because cockatoos can make alot of noise. They can acually screach as load as a professional rock concert, sports croud, or stock race car (135 decibles).
Cockatoo is much the same idea. When a file is changed itll notify you.
